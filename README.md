## 📊 Dataset

- **Source:** Climate change dataset (e.g., CO₂ levels, GDP, energy use, etc.)
- **Format:** Excel (`.xls`) and CSV
- **Preprocessing:** Cleaned using `pandas`, missing values handled, unnecessary columns removed.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Python 3.12 (Anaconda)**
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`, `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (for visualization)
  - `sklearn` (for modeling)
  - `xlrd` (for reading `.xls` files)

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SHXZ7/aicte-internship.git
   cd aicte_internship
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy xlrd matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run the notebook:
Open data_week1.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.

🚀 Output
Trained a predictive model to estimate carbon emissions based on selected features.
Performed basic visualizations to explore relationships between variables.
Prepared cleaned data ready for further analysis.
